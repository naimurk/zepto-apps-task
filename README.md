# Zepto Book List


This **Book List Project** is a dynamic web application that allows users to explore, search, and filter through a collection of books efficiently. The project focuses on delivering an optimized user experience through pagination, real-time search functionality, and persistent filter settings.

## Features

### 1. Efficient Data Handling with Pagination
- The book list is handled efficiently with pagination, ensuring fast loading times and smooth browsing even for large collections of books. Data is loaded in manageable chunks for a seamless experience.

### 2. Real-time Search Functionality
- Users can perform real-time searches as they type, instantly filtering books based on the search query. This feature provides immediate feedback and helps users find relevant books quickly.

### 3. Advanced Filtering Options
- **Subject-based Filtering**: Users can filter the book list by different subjects to narrow down their selection.
- **Bookshelf-based Filtering**: Books can also be filtered by bookshelf categories, giving users more control over their browsing preferences.

### 4. Persistent Filters on Page Refresh
- The project includes a persistence feature that remembers the user's last filter settings. When the page is refreshed, the selected filters remain in place, allowing users to continue their browsing session without losing their previous selections.

### 5. Wishlist Management
- Users can add books to their wishlist for future reference. The wishlist is easily manageable, with options to add or remove books at any time. This feature provides a personal space for users to save books they are interested in.

### 6. Interactive Animations and Modal for Book Genres

- A modal popup is available for viewing book genres in detail, offering a more interactive way to explore genre-related information.
